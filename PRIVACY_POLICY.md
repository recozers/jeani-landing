1\. Who we are & scope

This Privacy Policy describes how Jeani Health LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company, 1702 Woodburn Rd, Durham, NC 27705 ("Jeani," "we," "us"), processes personal data when you use our mobile app, firmware, websites, dashboards, and related services (the "Service").

* Account & contact data: name, email, profile details, settings.
* Device & usage data: device identifiers, OS/app version, events, diagnostics, crash logs.
* Movement & activity data ("Movement Data"): IMU/sensor signals, derived metrics, training context, symptoms you log.
* Context & relationships: Organizations/teams you join, your role, coaches/admins associated.
* Support & feedback: help tickets, surveys, beta feedback, in-app messages.
* Optional communications: your marketing preferences.

## 4\. How we collect data

* Directly from you (account sign-up, logs, settings, entries).
* Automatically from your device (events, performance, sensors with permissions).
* From Organization administrators, when you join a team space (only within the scope shown to you).

## 5\. How we use data (purposes)

* Provide, operate, and secure the Service (accounts, syncing, insights, support).

* Improve safety, reliability, and performance (analytics, testing, troubleshooting).
* Develop new features, models, and algorithms (including de-identified/aggregated statistics).

## 6\. Legal bases & consent

Where required, we rely on your consent to process Sensitive Data (Movement Data and any health-related information you provide). We may also rely on performance of a contract, legitimate interests (e.g., security, improvement), and legal obligations. Jeani is generally not a HIPAA "covered entity." We do not sign BAAs unless separately agreed in writing with an Organization.

## 7\. Confidentiality & security

* We treat your personal data and Movement Data as Confidential Information.
* We use encryption in transit, role-based access controls, logging/monitoring, least-privilege access, workforce training, and periodic reviews.
* We restrict access to personnel and service providers under written confidentiality obligations and need-to-know principles.

Incident response. If a security incident materially affects your personal data, we will notify you without undue delay (target within 72 hours) with available details and mitigation steps, subject to law-enforcement needs.

## 8\. Sharing your data

We share personal data:

* At your direction (e.g., joining an Organization). We display exact fields and recipients before you accept.
* With service providers (cloud, analytics, support) under binding confidentiality and data-protection terms.
* For legal reasons (compelled by law or to protect rights, safety, security).
* In business transfers (e.g., merger, acquisition, financing) with continuous protections and required notices.

We do not sell your personal data.

## 9\. Organization/Team spaces

When you join an Organization, designated admins/coaches may view data only within the scope shown to you during the join flow (e.g., weekly movement scores, symptom check-ins, trends). You can leave at any time; data shared while a member may remain available to that Organization per its policies.

## 10\. International transfers

We may process data in the United States and other countries using appropriate legal transfer mechanisms where required.

## 11\. Retention

We retain personal data as long as necessary to provide the Service and for legitimate business purposes (security, compliance), then delete or de-identify it. You may request deletion, subject to legal holds and exemptions.

## 12\. Your choices & rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or port data; object or restrict certain processing; and withdraw consent. Use in-app tools or contact ewan@jeanihealth.com. You may manage Organization connections, research invitations, and marketing preferences in Settings.

## 13\. Cookies / SDKs / analytics

We may use app SDKs and limited cookies on web properties for authentication, analytics, and performance. Manage permissions in your OS/app settings. Third-party tools are used under confidentiality and are not permitted to use your data for their own advertising.

## 14\. Third parties & links

Third-party services you connect are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. Review them before connecting.
